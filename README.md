# Visit Vikerfjell

This is a school project for my 4th semester at University College of Southeast Norway.
the group consisted of 4 students, and we buildt this webpage with pure HTML5, CSS3, PHP and JavaScript. We didn't use any library such as JQuery and Bootstrap (except icons from FontAwesome). This was to get a deeper understanding of the basic of each language. This project also included a report which formed the grade.
