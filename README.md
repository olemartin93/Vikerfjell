# Visit Vikerfjell

This is a school project for my 4th semester at University College of Southeast Norway.
the group consisted of 4 students, and we buildt this webpage with pure HTML5, CSS3, PHP and JavaScript. We didn't use any library such as JQuery and Bootstrap (except icons from FontAwesome). This was to get a deeper understanding of the basic of each language. This project also included a report which formed the grade.

## The project:
We were going to build a CMS without any frameworks or libraries, where an admin could log in and upload/change content on the main page. The admin could also edit the items on the navbar + do some other stuff. Our plan was to include a search bar and the ability to change between Norwegian and English, but since this project was only for one semester we didn't have the time.
